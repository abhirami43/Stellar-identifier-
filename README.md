## Introduction
Stellar Identifier is a machine learning project aimed at classifying stellar objects based on their characteristics. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms to accurately identify different types of stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies based on input data.

## Objective
The main objective of the project is to:
- Develop a classification model that can accurately classify stellar objects.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms and techniques for classification.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input data and get classification results.

## Features
- Preprocessing data to extract relevant features from astronomical data sets.
- Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector classifier (SVC), Decision Tree classifier, and K neighbor classifier for classification.
- Providing visualization tools to analyze and interpret classification results.
- User-friendly interface for users to input data and obtain classification predictions.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and machine learning
- Streamlite for web application development
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
